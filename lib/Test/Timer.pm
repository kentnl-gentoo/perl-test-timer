=head1 NAME

Test::Timer - test module to test/assert response times

=head1 VERSION

The documentation describes version 2.02 of Test::Timer

=head1 FEATURES

=over

=item * Test subroutines to implement unit-tests to time that your code executes before a specified threshold

=item * Test subroutines to implement unit-tests to time that your code execution exceeds a specified threshold

=item * Test subroutine to mplement unit-tests to time that your code executes within a specified time frame

=item * Supports measurements in seconds

=item * Implements configurable alarm signal handler to make sure that your tests do not execute forever

=back

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Timer;

    time_ok( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

    time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffYouHave10Seconds(); }, 10, 'threshold of 10 seconds');

    time_between( sub { doYourStuffYouHave5-10Seconds(); }, 5, 10,
        'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

    #Will succeed
    time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

    time_atleast( sub { sleep(2); }, 2, 'threshold of one second');

    #Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 2 seconds (default alarm)
    time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

    $test::Timer::alarm = 6 #default 2 seconds

    #Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 6 seconds (specified alarm)
    time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Timer implements a set of test primitives to test and assert test times
from bodies of code.

The key features are subroutines to assert or test the following:

=over

=item * that a given piece of code does not exceed a specified time limit

=item * that a given piece of code takes longer than a specified time limit
and does not exceed another

=back

=head1 EXPORT

Test::Timer exports:

=over

=item * L<time_ok|/time_ok>

=item * L<time_nok|/time_nok>

=item * L<time_atleast|/time_atleast>

=item * L<time_atmost|/time_atmost>

=item * L<time_between|/time_between>

=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 time_ok

Takes the following parameters:

=over

=item * a reference to a block of code (anonymous sub)

=item * a threshold specified as a integer indicating a number of seconds

=item * a string specifying a test name

=back


    time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test fail with the following diagnostic message

    Test ran 2 seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

=head2 time_nok

The is the inverted variant of L<time_ok|/time_ok>, it passes if the threshold is
exceeded and fails if the benchmark of the code is within the specified
timing threshold.

The API is the same as for L<time_ok|/time_ok>.

    time_nok( sub { sleep(1); }, 2, 'threshold of two seconds');

If the execution of the code executes below the threshold specified the test fail with the following diagnostic message

    Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

=head2 time_atmost

This is I<syntactic sugar> for L<time_ok|/time_ok>

    time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test fail with the following diagnostic message

    Test ran N seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

N will be the actual measured execution time of the specified code

=head2 time_atleast

    time_atleast( sub { doYourStuffAndTakeYourTimeAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of 1 second');

The test succeeds if the code takes at least the number of seconds specified by
the timing threshold.

If the code executes faster, the test fails with the following diagnosic message

    Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

Please be aware that Test::Timer, breaks the execution with an alarm specified
to trigger after the specified threshold + 2 seconds (default), so if you expect your
execution to run longer, set the alarm accordingly.

    $Test::Timer::alarm = $my_alarm_in_seconds;

See also L<diagnostics|/DIAGNOSTICS>.

=head2 time_between

This method is a more extensive variant of L<time_atmost|/time_atmost> and L<time_ok|/time_ok>, you
can specify a lower and upper threshold, the code has to execute within this
interval in order for the test to succeed

    time_between( sub { sleep(2); }, 5, 10,
        'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

If the code executes faster than the lower threshold or exceeds the upper threshold, the test fails with the following diagnosic message

    Test ran 2 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

Or

    Test ran 12 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

=head1 PRIVATE FUNCTIONS

=head2 _runtest

This is a method to handle the result from L<_benchmark|/_benchmark> is initiates the
benchmark calling benchmark and based on whether it is within the provided
interval true (1) is returned and if not false (0).

=head2 _benchmark

This is the method doing the actual benchmark, if a better method is located
this is the place to do the handy work.

Currently L<Benchmark> is used. An alternative could be L<Devel::Timer>, but I
do not know this module very well and L<Benchmark> is core, so this is used for
now.

The method takes two parameters:

=over

=item * a code block via a code reference

=item * a threshold (the upper threshold, since this is added to the default
alarm.

=back

=head2 _timestring2time

This is the method extracts the seconds from benchmarks timestring and returns
it as an integer.

It takes the timestring from L<_benchmark|/_benchmark> (L<Benchmark>) and returns the seconds
part.

=head2 import

Test::Builder required import to do some import I<hokus-pokus> for the test methods
exported from Test::Timer. Please refer to the documentation in L<Test::Builder>

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

All tests either fail or succeed, but a few exceptions are implemented, these
are listed below.

=over

=item * Test did not exceed specified threshold, this message is diagnosis for
L<time_atleast|/time_atleast> and L<time_nok|/time_nok> tests, which do not exceed their specified
threshold.

=item * Test exceeded specified threshold, this message is a diagnostic for
L<time_atmost|/time_atmost> and L<time_ok|/time_ok>, if the specified threshold is surpassed.

This is the key point of the module, either your code is too slow and you should
address this or your threshold is too low, in which case you can set it a bit
higher and run the test again.

=item * Test did not execute within specified interval, this is the diagnostic
from L<time_between|/time_between>, it is the diagnosis if the execution of the code is
not between the specified lower and upper thresholds.

=item * Insufficient parameters, this is the message if a specified test is not
provided with the sufficient number of parameters, consult this documentation
and correct accordingly.

=item * Execution exceeded threshold and timed out, the exception is thrown if
the execution of tested code exceeds even the alarm, which is default 2 seconds,
but can be set by the user or is equal to the upperthreshold + 2 seconds.

The exception results in a diagnostic for the failing test. This is a failsafe
to avoid that code runs forever. If you get this diagnose either your code is
too slow and you should address this or it might be error prone. If this is not
the case adjust the alarm setting to suit your situation.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

This module requires no special configuration or environment.

Tests are sensitive and be configured using environment and configuration files, please
see the section on L<test and quality|/TEST AND QUALITY>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=over

=item * L<Carp>

=item * L<Benchmark>

=item * L<Error>

=item * L<Test::Builder>

=item * L<Test::Builder::Module>

=back

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

This module holds no known incompatibilities.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This module holds no known bugs.

The current implementations only use seconds and resolutions should be higher,
so the current implementation is limited to seconds as the highest resolution.

On occassion failing tests with CPAN-testers have been observed. This seem to be related to the test-suite
being not taking into account that some smoke-testers do not prioritize resources for the test run and that
addional processes/jobs are running. The test-suite have been adjusted to accomodate this but these issues
might reoccur.
